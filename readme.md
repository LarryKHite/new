## This is the site for the **Infusing Computing Webseries**!

The site has been built using Jekyll. Individual posts for each episode power the RSS for Subscriptions via iTunes. 

Episodes can also be stream using the [Plyr](https://github.com/Selz/plyr) HTML/JS media player. All thanks for the site design was created using [Jekyll Skeleton](https://github.com/timklapdor/jekyll-skeleton) by Tim Klapdor.
