summary: "Like a lot of parents of small children, I have a love-hate relationship with family trips to the beach. We set out in the morning looking like we are about to shoot a J. Crew catalogue, only to return home hours later as though we have emerged from the ocean in a post-apocalyptic world. But our annual trips to Cox Bay Beach in Tofino, B.C. have easily become our favourite family vacay spot, so I have had to learn a bunch of tricks and hacks to make a beach day with kids a lot more enjoyable."
