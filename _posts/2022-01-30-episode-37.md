summary: "Babies do silly adorable things all the time and we are often left wondering why and how they seem to just casually adapt. One of the most adorable things to love about babies is their little sets of toes. We are all guilty of playing with baby feet just because of how cute they are. When doing so, you would have noticed that your baby clenches and unfurls its toes quite randomly. They don’t seem to be aware of doing it. If you are curious about why and how it happens, this post is for you!"
