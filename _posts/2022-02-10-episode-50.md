summary: "Feeling like a walking mom-zombie is expected when you have a newborn, but for many parents, the sleep deprivation becomes chronic. (A toddler who climbs out of the crib, a bedwetting preschooler, a school-ager with nightmares.) We joke about how tired we are, but year after year of broken sleep is actually wreaking havoc on our health.I remember it so vividly. It had been a good morning with my kids—Sophie, then three, and Juliette, just a few months old—and I was showered, dressed and wearing makeup (an impressive feat for a mama with two littles, I thought). Soph had been a dream about sitting for breakfast and getting dressed, and Juliette had nursed well and was babbling happily."
