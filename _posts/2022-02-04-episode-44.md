summary: "Every parent tends to think their child is the best, the brightest, and the most perfect specimen of humankind in the earliest days of parenthood. We need to feel that our kids are special and significant to the world to manage the 24-hour-a-day care that infants and children require from the get-go. It is hard work and we need to believe that our work has meaning. This narcissistic focus on the beauty of a newborn, though, should not grow into a narcissistic attachment that continues throughout the child’s life. Narcissistic parents can do a significant level of emotional damage to their children. Narcissistic parents are driven to control their children and wield their power in the family hierarchy; they use their children in a variety of ways to maintain the narcissist’s sense of self and inflated ego."
