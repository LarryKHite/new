summary: "REICG reinvests the cash flow generated from our real estate acquisitions into buying more properties. This investment methodology grows the Fund’s total cash flow, allowing the Fund to purchase ever more properties, growing the portfolio exponentially. REICG is a long term investment product that grows investor money through the appreciation of the value of the Fund. Most real estate investments are long term in nature with limited liquidity, but REICG has developed a liquidity vehicle to allow investors to liquidate their shares on their timeline."
