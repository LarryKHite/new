summary: "There are two main types of ferrets in North America: the domesticated ferret and wild ferrets. Wild ferrets are known as the black-footed ferrets. These ferrets are endangered in North America, which means they are in danger of disappearing forever. Domesticated ferrets are related to black-footed ferrets, but they are different. The ferrets that people keep as pets are not the same as ferrets that are endangered in the wild."
