summary: "With the surge of business activity in the post-pandemic era, a large number of people are relocating. Some who lost their jobs during the coronavirus lockdowns and moved back to their hometowns are now on the hunt for housing in the cities they were able to find new occupations in. On the other hand, businesses are also finding new locations for their offices as they call their employees back to the workplace from work-from-home. This scenario, where a lot of people are moving from one place to the other, has forced many to make a decision on which internet service provider (ISP) to choose. "
