summary: "Money makes the world go round and how much we have of it greatly influences our parenting and our parenting decisions. Rich moms and poor moms are equal in that we love our kids and want the best for them but their motherhood experience is vastly different. The more money we have, the easier life usually is. Money can't and won't buy happiness but it sure does help. The mom who works two jobs pinching pennies and struggles to afford new coats isn't as happy as the mom planning her family's second vacation of the year. When a person has a job or finances that allows them to pay their rent/mortgage, household bills, groceries, debt, child needs, and still have money left over, that's a blessing."
