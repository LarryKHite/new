summary: "Adding a second bundle of joy to your family comes with a whole new set of worries you hadn’t considered the first time around. Just about every expectant mom has some worries about what’s to come. What will labour be like? How do I install a car seat? What’s a swaddle? Can I actually do this? The list of things to stress about is endless. So you’d think it would be smooth sailing once you’ve had one child and are expecting a second baby. But the reality is just because you have car seats and swaddles figured out (maybe), doesn’t mean you’re cool as a cucumber when preparing for Baby Number 2. Adding a second bundle of joy to your family comes with a whole new set of worries you hadn’t considered the first time around. Here’s what you may be feeling (and trust us, everyone else is feeling it too)"
