summary: "The CDC has quietly removed crawling from their main milestones for babies in the United States. A few parents and development experts were surprised by this change, since it was previously considered to be a milestone reached around 9 months old (instead of 12). They also bumped forward walking from 16 months old onto 18 instead with talk now listed at 15 rather than just being held back until 22 month mark where they once stood before these changes took effect!"
