summary: "GPS collars, such as the SpotOn Virtual Smart Fence, are used primarily for pet containment and tracking. They provide a virtual fencing solution that allows pet owners to create a predetermined zone within which their pets can roam freely. This is particularly useful for those with large backyards or properties where physical fencing may not be feasible or desirable. The SpotOn Collar, for instance, comes with an app that enables live tracking and easy setup of the virtual fence. It uses a cellular data plan provided by SpotOn, which enables the GPS tracking system. The collar employs Patent True Location™ technology, which offers superior accuracy in GPS and location tracking compared to many other smart collar solutions on the market. One of the key benefits of GPS collars is their ability to provide real-time location data. This is particularly useful if a pet manages to escape the predetermined zone, as the owner can quickly locate and retrieve them. The SpotOn Collar, for example, provides super accurate GPS readings that show where your dog is at all times. However, it's important to note that these devices often require a subscription plan for full functionality, and there may be additional costs associated with data usage. The SpotOn Collar, for instance, requires a subscription plan for its GPS tracking system. In conclusion, GPS collars are used for creating virtual fences for pets, tracking their location in real-time, and ensuring their safety within a designated area. They offer a convenient and flexible solution for pet containment, particularly for those with large properties or specific containment needs."
