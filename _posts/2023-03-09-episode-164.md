summary: "GPS dog collars, such as the Halo Collar, have proven to be effective tools for pet owners. They provide a way to keep track of your dog's location through GPS and a mobile app. The Halo Collar is particularly unique as it allows the creation of virtual fences that provide safe and gentle feedback to your dog when they approach the edge of their designated areas. This is not a shock collar, but a safe and effective solution designed with the input of dog psychology expert, Cesar Millan.The collar also has a great GPS accuracy and an excellent customer service. However, it's worth noting that it comes with a price tag and requires a monthly subscription. Also, its battery life and suitability for very small dogs could be a concern for some. Despite these, the Halo Collar stands out as a viable option for dog owners who want to give their pets more freedom while ensuring their safety. It's important to note that while the collar provides a technological solution, it's also crucial to train your dog to understand the sound and vibration modes of the collar. This may take some time and effort, but it will ultimately improve your bond with your dog."
