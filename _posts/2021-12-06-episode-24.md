summary: "Most ferret owners either have a deaf ferret or know someone who has one. Deafness in the domestic ferret is fairly common especially in individuals having some degree of whiteness in their coat. It is estimated that approximately 75 % of all the ferrets with blaze and panda colourations are affected with the Waardenburg syndrome. The Waardenburg syndrome is responsible for hereditary deafness in some humans and has also been identified in the ferret."
