summary: "My son’s language might come as a surprise to some, but I think every preschooler should be as well versed in the basics of sex ed, including the fact that sex feels good. On a cool December morning when I was 38 weeks pregnant, I stepped out of bed and, with an audible, movie-perfect pop, felt my water break and begin to gush. As I grasped my belly and shouted for my husband with joy and a little bit of panic, my three-year-old dashed into the room and asked, with excitement in his eyes, Mommy, is it time for my brother to come out of your vagina?!"
