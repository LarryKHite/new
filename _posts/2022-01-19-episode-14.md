We already know this pandemic has been horrendous for teens and their mental health. Last month’s mental health advisory from the U.S. surgeon general underscored the magnitude of the issue, as feelings of hopelessness and even suicidality have been on the rise over the past several years among this age group, with the pandemic only adding to teens’ stress levels.
