summary: "I never saw the benefits of a traditional time out. But escaping to explore her creativity has helped my daughter manage her emotions and think of others. Last summer, my then 8-year-old daughter and I had an argument. I can’t even remember exactly what it was about, but I know I was fed up with my mini salesperson who was always trying to negotiate and had a hard time accepting no for an answer."
