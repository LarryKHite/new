summary: "With kids and cold weather comes winter gear. It’s a lot, it’s bulky and it can be a mess. The month of February — when we’re in the throes of cold weather — is the best time to tackle the mess. On a snowy day, when the kids are getting ready to go out to play, gather all the hats, gloves, mittens and scarves plus anything else worn in cold weather. Have the children put on their favorite and warmest gear. Pay attention to what they pass over, then send the kids out to play."
