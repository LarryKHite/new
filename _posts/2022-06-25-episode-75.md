summary: "I didn’t hesitate when my son asked if we could attend the Pride Parade. He wanted to see what it was like. So we went. We walked around the streets of San Francisco, and we saw all kinds of people. Some were dressed in colorful costumes, others were just wearing clothes they liked. And then there were those who were not dressed at all. There were drag queens and kings, transgender women and men, and everyone else in between. Everyone was different, yet they shared something in common: they were proud of themselves."
