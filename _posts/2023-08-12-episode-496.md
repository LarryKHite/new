summary: "A lot of people think that breastfeeding after an implant procedure is impossible, but they're wrong. In reality, most mothers who've had a cosmetic enhancement can continue to nurse their babies without any problems. The breasts themselves aren't affected by the operation, so they'll still produce milk just like before. However, the nipples might be sore for a little while after the procedure, and the incision site could take longer to heal. But these side effects won't last very long, and most moms say they're manageable."
