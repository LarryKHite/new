summary: "I had been watching my Ariocarpus fissurata lloydii since late summer, expecting a flower to pop out of the pretty white wool in the center of the plant. Nothing. I failed to take a picture of all that wool, but eventually one pink flower barely opened in the overcast skies we had for a few days.  I was busy and didn’t managed to get out there for a picture before it closed and would not reopen. Then, a few days later I was genuinely surprised and pleased to see these two blooms open. What fun! They reopened for two or three more days, which usually doesn’t always happen. "

I had been watching my Ariocarpus [/r/Ariocarpus - reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ariocarpus/) fissurata lloydii since late summer, expecting a flower to pop out of the pretty white wool in the center of the plant. Nothing. I failed to take a picture of all that wool, but eventually one pink flower barely opened in the overcast skies we had for a few days.  I was busy and didn’t managed to get out there for a picture before it closed and would not reopen. Then, a few days later I was genuinely surprised and pleased to see these two blooms open.
