summary: "Ferrets can bite for several reasons, and it is important to know the reason, that makes the correcting of the behavior much easier. Do not make a mistake to see playful biting as aggressive biting. Real biters will bite and will not let go, or will bite so hard that the teeth will go right through the flesh and start bleeding. Spray full biting is no more than taking a fast nibble, but playful biting needs to be corrected as well."
