summary: "Ferrets are sensitive animals who require a lot of care and attention if you decide to bring one into your home. Recently, they’ve become quite common as companion animals. Perhaps in response to their popularity, ferret shows have been popping up all over the world for several years now. What are Ferret Shows? There are two different types of shows: Specialty and Championship. Championship shows involve rating the overall characteristics of the ferret. This includes, body structure, conformation, muscle tone, temperament, maintenance (how well the owner takes care of the ferret), and, to a lesser degree, their color, according to Kym Costanzo, Vice President and Director of Shelter Operations at The Pennsylvania Ferret Club and Shelter."
